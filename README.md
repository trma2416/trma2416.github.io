Welcome to my personal website! Here you will be able to follow my progress on projects and stay up to date with anything I'm working on. 


Week of 5-19-2025

During the First week I took the time to figure out what goals I wanted to achieve for myself and what would be the best course of action. Some things I want to achieve with this class and as a professional is to A) gain professional experience in an internship, and B) develop a project that would be beneficial in helping me gain admission to a masters program. On one side I want to work with software engineering type roles and on the other, data science and data engineering. My choices included creating a web-based application to showcase my developer and engineering skills, or working with what Dr. Curry suggested working with a nanoGPT. After much back and forth I decided I want to follow what interests me more and that would be designing a project around the nanoGPT. 

For this week, I plan on finding what I would like goals I would like it to accomplish as far as a the nanoGPT and how I would like to taylor it to fit my needs. I want this project to demonstrate my understanding of AI transformer models and be able to use it in a process I want. I have a journal titled "Attention Is All You Need" written by google researchers et al. and I'd like to dive into that article and gain a deeper understanding.  I also plan on working on my website more and addressing more of the aesthetics of my website such that it is more visually appealing.

One thing that is impeding my progress is my understanding of the tensorflow and huggingface modules and methods and how to use them in the most efficient way. This is going to take some research in the beginning and I'm hoping that it does not come at the cost of me completing this project. 

Something I need to work on this week that I didn't work on last week is setting aside a time with no distractions and actually mapping out the 3-5 hours this week that I need in order to complete this project. One thing I want to work on throughout this project is optimizing my time management skills such that I never feel stressed or behind on this project and feel that I am making meaningful progress.
