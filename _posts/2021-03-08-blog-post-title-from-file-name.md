## Project Proposal Summer 2025

Vision statement: For my project I will be implementing an AI chatbot. This chatbot will act as a customer service representative for a toy business example. In order to achieve this, I will need to extract or create training data for a sample business, and use that data to train the model. Some example data could be product descriptions, product usage, troubleshooting with the products, applications and much more. This data will be used such that the model can generate customized information when queried by a potential customer. For my model, I will start with creating a nanoGPT from Karpathy’s nanoGPT github repository. Then, I will modify the model, such as the architecture, the training data, the tokenizer and potentially more depending on the requirements of my model. I will make use of online resources starting with some that Dr. Guinn suggested, and expand my research as necessary. This will give me a good sense of what I need to change in order for my model to work best for my application. This project will give me insight into how AI models work under the hood. I plan on knowing the ins and outs of transformer models and being able to customize them to fit my goals which I will demonstrate in this project.

 

Motivation: This project is important to me because it will allow me to show potential employers and schools that I have the capability to wrestle with difficult concepts in data science and AI such that I can be a competitive candidate. I want to show that I can take on my own projects and produce a viable result in a reasonable amount of time. I wish to show my readiness for these kinds of roles and research as well.

 

Specific and measurable goals For the purposes of this project I will focus on the fundamentals of a GPT model thus implying that this will be a back-end development. Given the time constraints of this project, my goal for each week is to set aside a specific amount of time to work to complete this project. For me, I feel that setting milestone goals is not necessarily how I work due to factors such as debugging and other unforeseen factors. However, to be realistic, I think I will aim to have most of the code written out about a month out of the deadline and use the rest of the time to debug, and pretty up the project such that it is legible and that I fully understand what is happening.

 

Risks to project completion Some risks to the project completion is the time restraint and given that all of these topics are foreign to me and it will take me some time to fully grasp what is occurring. This includes new technologies and concepts such as pytorch library and transformer architectures. I am also new to data science as a whole and the fundamental math that underlies transformer models. As I am working on my code now, I am slowing it down and taking notes of how everything works and making sure that I understand what is occurring before moving on. Obviously this is not an optimal process but it makes it so that I can fully understand everything I am doing. At the end of this project, even if not complete, I want to be able to answer any questions about how and why my code works with full confidence to demonstrate what I’ve learned and how deep my understanding is. 

 

Mitigation Strategy Part of my mitigation strategy is to do online tutorials on pytorch and hugging face, as well as youtube tutorials by accredited pages. Reading scholarly articles is also a good resource to look at especially when trying to understand fundamental concepts. I also plan on setting aside 5+ hours a week with no distractions to ensure that I am given ample time to work towards the completion of this project. 

 

Project Assessments For my assessments, I will need to create some verification testing for each part of the project with different examples to ensure that everything is working properly. This will involve creating toy scenarios and analyzing the results produced from my model compared to what I expect it to produce. This also comes down to how much training I do on the model to further modify parameters such that the cost functions are minimized to the point that satisfies a consensus criteria given by other language models. This will involve some data analysis that I will visualize with plots.
