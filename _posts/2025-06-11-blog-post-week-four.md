Last Week I submitted my project proposal and finished up my personal website. 

For this week, I have read some of my peers' project proposals and submitted my reviews. I will make sure that my website is what I need it to be and dive into my project. I received some good feedback on my proposal and I plan to implement a weekly schedule to stay up to date with my project such that it is completed by the end of the summer. By the end of this week, as part of my weekly plan, I should finish up my nanoGPT and familiarize myself with the code and set up my development environment. I've already created virtual environments to run my code thus far which contains all of the libraries for my nanoGPT. I will need to structure my modules in an efficient way to develop and test my code which I will do research on and see what the sort of industry standard is for setting this up. I also plan on doing some tutorials on youtube to gain some confidence in the libraries that I am using.
