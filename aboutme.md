## About Me

A little bit of background about me — I grew up in a small mountain town in southwest Colorado called Durango. Growing up, I took full advantage of the surrounding wilderness by mountain biking, fly fishing, hiking, camping, snowboarding, rock climbing, and enjoying many other outdoor activities. While in high school, I discovered that I had an aptitude for math, and in college, I wanted to explore that curiosity further.

## Education

Following my interests, I began attending the University of Colorado Boulder in 2018. Initially, I was an undeclared major and unsure of what career path I wanted to pursue. After a year of discussion with friends and family, I decided to pursue a degree in Physics. I earned a B.A. in Physics in the fall of 2022.

During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to perform research in renewable energy — specifically in battery technology — where I used optical techniques to analyze materials used in developing technologies. This was my first significant experience with coding, where I used Python for data manipulation and visualization to conduct the analysis. This sparked my interest in computer science and made me eager to learn more.

As of fall 2024, I am a student in the Applied Computer Science program at the University of Colorado Boulder, pursuing a B.S. in Applied Computer Science. I aspire to gain acceptance into a graduate program in Computer Science or Data Science.

## Technical Skills

So far, I have learned C++ and Python. In my previous research experience, I used Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scipy`, `lmfit`, and `numpy` for peak fitting, along with `matplotlib` for data visualization. In my academic program, I have studied data structures and algorithms and applied them to solve real-world problems. Some of the technologies and tools I am currently learning include Git and GitHub, CMake, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and more.
